/**
 * Rebuild a crew member's [StatsSnapshot] from what they shared, so their page can be drawn with
 * the very same screen we draw for ourselves.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately not re-derived from the shared history window: lifetime totals and
 * records. Both are sent whole in [CrewStatsExtras] precisely because the window is finite, and a
 * number that quietly shrank on someone else's phone would be worse than no number at all.
 *
 * A member on a build that predates the extras still gets a page — it just carries the 30 daily
 * totals every snapshot has always had, and [StatsSnapshot.rhythm] stays empty. Ask
 * [hasFullStats] before promising the reader an hour-by-hour chart.
